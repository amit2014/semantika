/**
 * Utility class to verify conversion between two different types. The implementation follows:
 * {@link http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xquery-operators-20020816/#casting-from-primitive-to-primitive}.
 * <p>
 * Extra notes:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Conversion from xsd:string to rdf:Literal is NOT possible because RDF Literal is not a type.
 *    The reverse behaves the same.</li>
 * <li>Conversion from xsd:string to rdf:PlainLiteral is NOT possible because the strict ruling of
 *    RDF Plain Literal requires at least one @ (U+0040) character. This implementation takes a general
 *    view that a value with XSD String type is just a sequence of characters without any symbolic
 *    purpose. Thus, although an XSD-String value has @ character, it doesn't serve as a language tag
 *    indicator as defined in RDF Plain Literal. However, the reverse is possible with a non-reversible
 *    effect such that the converted value won't give any meaning to @ character once it is converted
 *    to XSD String. (Reference: {@link
 *    http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-plain-literal/#Definition_of_the_rdf:PlainLiteral_Datatype}).</li>
 * <li>Conversion from xsd:string to rdf:XMLLiteral is possible because rdf:XMLLiteral is a type. The
 *    reverse behaves the same. (Reference: {@link
 *    http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#section-XMLLiteral}).</li>
